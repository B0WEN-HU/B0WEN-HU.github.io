Hi, This is my weekly report this week.

--------------------------

## Progress this week
I was working on my final exam this week, so I did not do much actual work. But I post a report about the implementation of the `Verilog_data` class, you can find it [here](https://b0wen-hu.github.io/2019/06/16/Implementation-of-Verilog_data/).

## Plan next week
I will work on the parse function next week, but I plan to move the function from `Verilog_data` to the block class.

## Issue(s)
Though my final exam is not over yet, I will more time in the next week.

--------------------------

See you next week.
