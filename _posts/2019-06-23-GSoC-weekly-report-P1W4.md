Hi, This is my weekly report this week.

--------------------------

## Progress this week
I planned to work on the parse function this week, but this week's two major exams took me more time than I expected. I did not finish it.

Fortunately, I got good suggestions on the mailing list from SÃ©bastien this week, where he suggested that it could be done by forcing the the port names and using a defined interface like AXI4 stream, and I agree with him.

## Plan next week
Glance over AXI4 stream protocol, and implement this interface. The parse function was delayed until later.

## Issue(s)
The parse function was delayed until I found a better solution.

--------------------------

See you next week.
