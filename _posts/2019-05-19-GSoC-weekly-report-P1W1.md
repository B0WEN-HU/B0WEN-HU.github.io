Hi, This is my weekly report this week.

--------------------------

## Progress this week
I built the overall structure of the verilog simulation block this week. you can find the report which discussed details about the structure [here](https://b0wen-hu.github.io/2019/05/29/GSoC-Structure-of-the-Verilog-simulation-block/ "Structure").

## Plan next week
Build the Verilog_data, Shell_cmd and Shared_lib class. Implement them with default rules.

## Issue(s)
After two weeks, I will have my final exam. I may need to take some time to review for the exam, but I think I can still catch up.

--------------------------

See you next week.
